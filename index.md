This is a resource for creating your own personal little cable company.
Personally, I'm aiming for a 12 channel system, including a program guide
channel, a weather channel, and more. Check out my system status
[here.](/my-setup)

## Why would anyone do that?
{: #why}

For fun, mostly. Play with some new-to-you technology and create your own channels with their own personas.

## How do you do it?
{: #how}

Like many hobbies, there are varying degrees of how "into it" you get. It all depends on how much time and money you are willing to put into it, and where you begin to start seeing diminishing returns. We'll outline several different setups along with the equipment and costs involved. Any of these approaches are valid if they fit your money/effort budget.

### Big Picture Objective, Regardless of Project Scale

Whether you have a single channel displayed on a computer or dozens of channels available to TVs throughout your house, your core objective is simple: **have one or more video feeds of scheduled content delivered to a display.**
