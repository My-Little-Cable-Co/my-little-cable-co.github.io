Sometime in 2019, I became very aware of how much time I spent on my phone. I
would read news, I would read about the news, I would discuss the news, and I
would react and read others reactions to the news on social media. My
hyper-awareness of every little awful thing that happened kept me glued to my
screen, and I began to realize just how much this arrangement was a benefit to
news and social media organizations, and just how much of a detriment it was
to me. It is imperitive that we stay in tune with and informed of the world
around us, but I was lacking a healthy balance. In short, I needed to log off,
and so do you, probably.

As I started to step back from being so plugged in, I immediately saw what I
had been missing out on. Colors were brighter and nature was louder. There
were things happening all around me that I had been previously oblivious to. I
continued to further simplify my life, and happiness followed.

How on Earth does this lead to buying a bunch of old hotel cable TV equipment
off ebay?

Well I started daydreaming about just how simple my life could be. I work
remotely, I could sell my house, buy an RV park, and live in a cabin in a
rural area. I could find like-minded folks to live in other cabins on the same
land. We could grow some of our own food. I found a wikipedia article called
"Permaculture", it sounds pretty neat. It would be a private community.
Isolated, but not alone.

Around the same time, my wife and I started watching Star Trek: Voyager. It
doesn't get much more isolated than that. I started thinking about all the
self-contained systems on board that supported their life. It's kind of like a
cruise ship, only in space. Well sometime around season 5 my mind hopped on a
train of thought that went something like:


"Do they have TV on Voyager?"


"It's 2020 and all the shows I enjoy watching are in 4:3 standard definition."


"I wish I had watched this in its original run."


"I wish I could subscribe to a cable company that was stuck in the 90s, commercials and all."


"Hmmm, how does cable TV work, anyway?".


I paused the show, did some light
researching, and with more arrogance than I have ever mustered before, I
decided, "I can make my own cable company".

Let's see how I do.
