      <h2 id="what">What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        This is a resource for creating your own personal little cable company.
      </p>
      <h2 id="why">Why would anyone do that?</h2>
      <p>
        For fun, mostly. But also because media you don't control will always seek to control you.
      </p>
      <p>
        TV entertains, and TV influences. TV connects us with a common culture. What if you reject that culture, and the influence that comes with it? Whether it is traditional cable service, video sharing websites, or social media, we are not in complete control over what content gets pushed to us. The channels show you what the media corportation decided you should see. The video sharing sites and social media sites are incentivised to keep you watching. They don't care what you watch, only that you contribute to their never-ending organizational goal of "people watch more". This has resulted in the indoctrination of thousands, as the automated recommendations trend towards the extremes of topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you manage to avoid extremist content, you are still likely benefiting the authors of said content. In the case of bundled content, like traditional cable services, even if you are morally opposed to a channel's content, a portion of your bill helps fund it. Every month. This applies to newer, streaming-based live TV services as well. <a href="https://unfoxmycablebox.com/">If you are able to watch a channel, you are paying for that channel, and supporting everything they support.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        By curating your own content and providing your own service, you can avoid the pitfalls that come with modern media.
        Or... maybe you just want to play with some new-to-you technology and create your own channels with their own personas.
      </p>
      <h2 id="how">How do you do it?</h2>
      <p>
        Like many hobbies, there are varying degrees of how "into it" you get. It all depends on how much time and money you are willing to put into it, and where you begin to start seeing diminishing returns. We'll outline several different setups along with the equipment and costs involved. Any of these approaches are valid if they fit your money/effort budget.
